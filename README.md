## Short Project Description
The idea of this project is to design a machine learning algorithm that is able to predict the results between different teams and choose the best team. We will be trying multiple frameworks/libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow before choosing which one will fit and work with our model. Our dataset will include information about players performance, player rating, team performance, and team rating. This project will allow fans and the general public to predict who will most likely win the next soccer game. Our project will be applicable and beneficial to the sports betting industry, sports commentary and analysis industry, and general debates between fans of soccer teams.
